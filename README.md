## Overview

**PREP-SHOT** (**P**athways for **R**enewable **E**nergy **P**lanning coupling **S**hort-term **H**ydropower **O**pera**T**ion) is a transparent, modular, and open-source energy expansion model, offering advanced solutions for multi-scale, intertemporal, and cost-effective expansion of energy systems and transmission lines. It's developed by [Zhanwei Liu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhanwei-Liu-4) and [Xiaogang He](http://hydro.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~hexg/) from the [PREP-NexT](https://github.com/PREP-NexT) Lab at the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/).

## Key Features

- Optimization model based on linear programming for multi-zone energy systems.
- Cost minimization while meeting given demand time series.
- Adjustable operation on hourly-spaced time steps.
- Input data in Excel format and output data in NetCDF format using ``Xarray``.
- Support for multiple solvers like Gurobi, CPLEX, MOSEK, and GLPK via `Pyomo`.
- Allows input of multiple scenarios for specific parameters.
- A pure Python program, leveraging ``pandas`` and ``Xarray`` for simplified complex data analysis and extensibility.

## Getting Started

This section includes a brief tutorial on running your first PREP-SHOT model.

1. Clone the repo

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PREP-NexT/PREP-SHOT.git
    ```

2. Create the Conda Environment and install the dependencies

    ```bash
    conda env create -f prep-shot.yml
    ```

3. Activate the Conda Environment

    ```bash
    conda activate prep-shot-test
    ```

4. Run your first model

    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```

This example is inspired by real-world data. For a detailed elaboration of this tutorial, check out the [Tutorial Page](https://prep-next.github.io/PREP-SHOT/Tutorial.html) in our documentation.

## Disclaimer

The PREP-SHOT model is an academic project and is not intended to be used as a precise prediction tool for specific hydropower operations or energy planning. The developers will not be held liable for any decisions made based on the use of this model. We recommend applying it in conjunction with expert judgment and other modeling tools in a decision-making context.
